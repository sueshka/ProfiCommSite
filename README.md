!WARNING!
Some parts of the code may contain my shitcode that might make no logical sense to you, but at least I've tried.
The design was made by me as well that's why it took me more time to finish my side of the project. 
I tried to comment on every piece of code that I felt needed explanation, so I hope it will be understandable.
ChatGPT was al;so involved at some point (Mostly in global css, while I did adaptivki)
